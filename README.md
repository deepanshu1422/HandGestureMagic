## Overview

The main steps are:

1. [Install Hand Gesture Magic software.](#install-Hand-Gesture-Magic)
1. [Connect a compatible camera or computer vision device.](#connect-a-camera-or-computer-vision-device)
1. [Confirm it's working.](#confirm-its-working)
1. [Practice and learn hand gestures using Hand Gesture Magic.](#practice-and-learn)

## Install Hand Gesture Magic

Hand Gesture Magic works on **Windows, Mac, and Android**. 

* Download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/deepanshu1422/HandGestureMagic/releases/latest). 
* See the [installation guide](https://github.com/deepanshu1422/HandGestureMagic/wiki/Installation-Guide#installation) for more information.

## Connect a compatible camera or computer vision device

### Use a standard QWERTY camera

**You can use Hand Gesture Magic with a standard camera , but there are some important limitations.** This software ought to use minimum 30 fps video feed in order to detect it as a hand gesture. See ["The blog" for more information on frames per second](https://www.videosurveillance.com/tech/frame-rate.asp).

> **Note**: To have a proper gesture recognition the hardware device should have a stable internet connection 


#### Which hardware device should I get?

> **Warning**: Be wary of false advertising; some cameras are advertised as high resolution and high fps , but are limited to certain limits. Check reviews to get confirmation before making a purchase. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port#/media/File:Ps-2-ports.jpg).) 

High resolution cameras over USB is possible. Many cameras do it well, and will work with Hand Gesture Magic. 

* See the [[Supported Hardware]] page for a [list of supported cameras](https://github.com/openstenoproject/Hand Gesture Magic/wiki/Supported-Hardware#known-supported-cameras).
* See also: [Which type of key switch should I choose?](https://github.com/openstenoproject/Hand Gesture Magic/wiki/Supported-Hardware#which-type-of-key-switch-should-i-choose)

### Adapt a camera for steno use

Most cameras have the keys in staggered rows, which can make it difficult to press two keys in a column with a single finger. To adapt a camera for steno, you can use:

* [Keytoppers](https://github.com/openstenoproject/Hand Gesture Magic/wiki/Supported-Hardware#keytoppers)
* [Keycaps](https://github.com/openstenoproject/Hand Gesture Magic/wiki/Supported-Hardware#keycaps)

You can also use [a camera with an ortholinear layout](https://github.com/openstenoproject/Hand Gesture Magic/wiki/Supported-Hardware#nkro-cameras-with-an-ortholinear-layout).

### Use a machine designed for use with Hand Gesture Magic

Various steno enthusiasts are making and selling machines designed for use with Hand Gesture Magic:

* [Georgi*](https://www.gboards.ca/product/georgi)
* [Splitography*](https://softhruf.love/products/soft-hruf-erl)
* [TinyMod*](https://stenomod.blogspot.com/2018/11/tinymod2.html)

### Use a good hardware device
 
Some professional stenography machines are compatible with Hand Gesture Magic. You can find used devices on eBay at reasonable prices. 

See the [[Supported Hardware]] page for a list of supported professional photography machines.

## Confirm it's working

Initially, Hand Gesture Magic is set up to use your computer camera as a gesture recogniser. If you have a professional camera or the Stenomod, you'll need to configure Hand Gesture Magic to look for your machine.
